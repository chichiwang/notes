## Definition
> A programming paradigm is an approach to programming a computer based on a mathematical theory or a coherent set of principles. Each paradigm supports a set of concepts that makes it the best for a certain kind of problem.

~ Peter Van Roy

Different programming problems need different programming concepts to solve them cleanly. Many languages [support multiple paradigms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_multi-paradigm_programming_languages) allowing programmers to tackle problems in different ways.

*Languages* realize one or more programming *paradigms*. *Paradigms* consist of a set of *concepts*.

Many programming paradigms are as well known for the techniques that they *discourage*/*forbid* as for those that they *encourage*.

## Taxonomy Of Programming Paradigms

![Taxonomy Of Programming Paradigms](./images/taxonomy.png)

* There are 27 boxes
* Each box represents a paradigm as a set of programming concepts
* 8 boxes contain 2 paradigms with different names but the same set of concepts
* An arrow between two boxes represents the concept(s) that have to be added to go from one paradigm to the next
* Concepts are the basic, primitive elements used to construct the paradigms
* When a language is mentioned under a paradigm it means that the designers intended part of the language to support the paradigm without interference from other paradigms
  * It does not mean that there is a perfect fit between the language and the paradigm
* The taxonomy diagram shows two important properties of paradigms
  * Whether they have observable nondeterminism
  * How strongly they support state

Often two paradigms that seem quite different differ by just one concept (for example: functional programming vs. object-oriented programming).

A paradigm almost always has to be turing complete to be practical.

**Note**: This taxonomy contains a lot of information and warrants careful examination.

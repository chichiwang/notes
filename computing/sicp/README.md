## The Wizard Book
[Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_and_Interpretation_of_Computer_Programs), also known as **SICP** or **The Wizard Book** is a computer science textbook by [MIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology) professors Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman with Julie Sussman. It teaches the fundamental principles of computer programming, including *recursion*, *abstraction*, *modularity*, and programming language design and implementation.

These notes will follow a reading and study of the material found in the [second edition](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0262510871).

# Crash Course: Computer Science - WIP
**Author**: [Chi-chi Wang](https://github.com/chichiwang)

Notes on a series of videos produced by PBS digital studios and shared on Youtube on the field of computer science.

In this course Carrie Anne Philbin outlines the history and design decisions that led to modern computers, describes the basic elements of computing and software, identifies and explains the basic components of computer hardware, and discusses how far computers have gone and where they may yet go.

The earliest recognized device for computing was the abacus, invented in ancient Mesopotamia around 2,500 BCE. It was a manual calculator for adding and subtracting numbers and stores the current state of the computation.

Each row of beads represents a different power of 10, with the bottom row representing 1s, the next row representing 10s, the next 100s, and so on.

As early computer pioneer, Charles Babbage, once said:
```
At each increase of knowledge, as well as on the contrivance of every new tool, human labour becomes abridged.
```

The earliest documented use of the word "computer" was from 1613 in a book by Richard Brathwaite, _The Yong Mans Gleanings_.

In those days, a computer was a person who did calculations and not a machine. This job title persisted until the late 1800s. It was then the meaning of the word "computer" started shifting to refer to devices.

Notable among these devices was the [step reckoner](https://www.britannica.com/technology/Step-Reckoner) built by German polymath Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz in 1694. It was the first machine that could compute addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Before the twentieth century most people experienced computing through [precomputed tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precomputation). [Range tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_table) were used to calculate the angle of artilitary to hit targets well into WWII. The problem with range tables were that they would need to be recomputed for every change made to the cannons or shells.

Charles Babbage acknowledged this limitation in his paper _Note on the Application of Machinery to the Computation of Astronomical and Mathematical Tables._ in 1822 published to the Astronomical Society of London.

Babbage proposed a mechanical device called the [Difference Engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_engine), a complex machine that could calculate polynomials. Babbage started construction on this machine in 1823 and over the next two decades tried to fabricate and assemble the over 25,000 components. The project was ultimately abandoned. In 1991 historians completed construction on a difference engine based on Babbage's drawings and writings - and it worked.

During construction of the difference engine, Babbage imagined an even more complex machine: the [analytical engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_Engine). Unlike all of the other computational devices before it, the analytical engine was a "general purpose computer." It could be used for many different computations, be given data and run operations in sequence, it had memory and even a primitive printer. This device, too, was never fully constructed.

English mathematician Ada Lovelace wrote hypothetical programs for the analytical engine. For her work Ada is often considered the world's first programmer.

The analytical engine would go on to inspire the first generation of computer scientists, who incorporated many of Babbage's ideas into their machines. This is why Babbage is often considered the father of computing.

In 1890, Herman Hollerith developed the [tabulating machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabulating_machine) to help process the data from the U.S. census. This tabulating machine was roughly 10x faster than manual tabulations and the census was completed in 2.5 years, aving the census office millions of dollars.

Businesses saw the potential of these machines to assist in other tasks, such as accounting, insurance appraisals, and inventory management. To meet the demand Hollerith founded the Tabulating Machine Company which later merged with other machine makers in 1924 to become the International Business Machines Corporation (IBM).

By the mid-1900s the explosion in world population and the rise in globalized trade demanded faster and more effective tools for processing data - setting the stage for digital computers.

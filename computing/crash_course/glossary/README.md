# Glossary
## [Binary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary)
Means "of two states". From the latin "consisting of two". [Binary numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number) are numbers represented by two digits. [Binary code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_code) consists of instructions consisting of two symbols.

## [Diode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diode)
An electronic component that permits the one-way flow of current. A diode is a kind of [vacuum tube](#vacuum-tube).

## [Logic Gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_gate)
A physical electronic/electromechanical device implementing a boolean function. It performs a logical operation on one or more binary inputs to produce a single binary output.

## [Relay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relay)
Electronically controlled, mechanical switches. In a relay a control wire connected to a coil of wire which is used to create an electromagnetic field when current flows through. This field attracts a metal arm inside the relay, completing a circuit.

## [Transistor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor)
Similar to a [relay](#relay) or [vacuum tube](#vacuum-tube) a transistor is a switch that can be opened or closed via the application of a current to a control wire. Typically a transistor consists of two electrodes separated by a gate electrode (a semiconductor). By changing the electrical charge of the gate, the conductivity of the semiconductor could be manipulated.

## [Vacuum Tube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_tube)
A device that controls electric current flow in a high vacuum between electrodes to which an electric potential difference has been applied.

# Glossary
## [Binary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary)
Means "of two states". From the latin "consisting of two". [Binary numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number) are numbers represented by two digits. [Binary code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_code) consists of instructions consisting of two symbols.

## [Bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit)
A basic unit of information in computing and digital communications. The name "bit" is a portmanteau of "binary digit." The bit represents a logical state with one of two possible values.

## [Byte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte)
A unit of digital information that most commonly consists of 8 [bits](#bit). This is the smallest addressable unit of memory in many computer architectures (due to hardware), and is historically the number of bits used to encode a single character of text in a computer.

## [Diode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diode)
An electronic component that permits the one-way flow of current. A diode is a kind of [vacuum tube](#vacuum-tube).

## [Floating Point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic)
Arithmetic using formulaic representation of real numbers as an approximaton to support a trade-off between range and precision. The term _floating point_ refers to the fact that a number's radix point (decimal point) can "float" anywhere relative to the significant digits of the number.

## [Interoperability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interoperability)
A characteristic of a product or system, whose interaces are completely understood, to work with other products or systems, at present or in the future, in either implementation or access, without any restrictions. The term was initially defined for information technology or systems engineering services to allow for information exchange.

## [Logic Gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_gate)
A physical electronic/electromechanical device implementing a boolean function. It performs a logical operation on one or more binary inputs to produce a single binary output.

## [Positional Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positional_notation)
A way of representing the values of a positional system (a numeral system in which the contribution of a digit to the value of a number is the product of the value of the digit by a factor determined by the position of the digit).

## [Relay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relay)
Electronically controlled, mechanical switches. In a relay a control wire connected to a coil of wire which is used to create an electromagnetic field when current flows through. This field attracts a metal arm inside the relay, completing a circuit.

## [Transistor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor)
Similar to a [relay](#relay) or [vacuum tube](#vacuum-tube) a transistor is a switch that can be opened or closed via the application of a current to a control wire. Typically a transistor consists of two electrodes separated by a gate electrode (a semiconductor). By changing the electrical charge of the gate, the conductivity of the semiconductor could be manipulated.

## [Vacuum Tube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_tube)
A device that controls electric current flow in a high vacuum between electrodes to which an electric potential difference has been applied.

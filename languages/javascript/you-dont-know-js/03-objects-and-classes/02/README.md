# Chapter 2: How Objects Work
Objects are not just containers for multiple values. To fully understand the object mechanism in JavaScript, a closer look at a number of characteristics of objects and their properties is required.

The characteristics that define the underlying behavior of objects are collectively referred to, in formal terms, as the _[metaobject](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaobject) proObject Foundationstocol_ (MOP). The MOP is useful for understanding how objects behave in JavaScript, as well as for understanding how to override the default behaviors of objects to better suit the needs of a given program.

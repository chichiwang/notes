## What's With That Name?
When Brendan Eich first conceived of the language he code-named it Mocha. The name LiveScript was used internally at Netscape. The name JavaScript was used publicly because it was originally designed to appeal to mostly Java programmers and the word "script" was popular at that time to refer to lightweight programs. These scripts would be the first to embed inside the pages of the web. The name "JavaScript" was a marketing ploy to position the language as an alternative to Java on the web.

There are some superficial similarities between JavaScript and Java that come from both languages targeting developers with assumed syntax expectations from C and C++:
* `{` is used to denote a block of code and `}` denotes the end of a block
* `;` is used to punctuate the end of a statement

The company Oracle (via Sun) owns the official trademark for the name "JavaScript" via Netscape. This trademark is almost never enforced (and likely couldn't be at this point). The official name of the language specified by TC39 and formalized by the ECMA standards body is **ECMAScript**. Since 2016 the official language name has also been suffixed by the revision year, for example: **ECMAScript 2019** (abbreviated as **ES2019**).

The JavaScript that runs inside of Node or the browser is an implementation of ECMAScript.

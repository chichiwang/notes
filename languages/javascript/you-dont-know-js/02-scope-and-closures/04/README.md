# Chapter 4: Around The Global Scope
The global scope of a JavaScript program is a rich topic, with more utility and nuance than one might assume. This chapter explores how the global scope is (still) useful and relevant to writing JavaScript programs today. It looks at the differences in _where_ and _how_ to access the global scope in different JavaScript environments.

Fully understanding the global scope is critical to mastery of using lexical scope to structure programs.

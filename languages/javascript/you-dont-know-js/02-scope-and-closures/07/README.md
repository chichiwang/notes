# Chapter 7: Using Closures
Closures are central to using scope effectively in the structure of a program. Closure builds on the approach that, for variables necessary for use over time, instead of placing them in outer scopes, these variables can be encapsulated in a narrower scope while preserving access to them from within functions. Functions maintain access to referenced scoped variables via closure.

Closure is one of the most important language characteristics ever invented in programming. It underlies major programming paradigms including Functional Programming (FP), modules, and even a bit of class-oriented design.

A high level investigation into the Java Programming Language. This is meant to be a profile of the language itself more than an investigation of the syntax and operations.

## Profile
* General purpose programming language
  * As opposed to a Domain Specific Language (DSL)
* Class-based
* Object-oriented
* Designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible
* Intended to be *write once, run anywhere*
* Compiled to byte code and run on any Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
* Syntax is similar to *C* and *C++*
  * Has fewer low-level facilities than either of them

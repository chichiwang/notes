# Collections
[Chapter Link](https://gigamonkeys.com/book/collections.html)

Common Lisp provides standard data types that collect multiple values into a single object. Every language approaches collections a little bit differently but basic collection types usually boil down to:
* Integer-indexed array type: _arrays_, _lists_, or _tuples_.
* Table type that can be used to map keys to values: _hash tables_, _associative arrays_, _maps_, _dictionaries_.

Lisp is famous for its list data structure and most Lisp books start their discussion of Lisp's collections with lists. However, it is a mistake to focus too much on lists; while they are a crucial data structure for representing Lisp code as Lisp data, in many situations other data structures are more appropriate.

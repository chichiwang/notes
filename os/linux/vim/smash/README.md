## Vim
The [vim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)) text editor was specifically built to help programmers edit text more efficiently, because of its origins in the terminal. It can be daunting, but it is not as hard as it looks.

The benefits of learning vim include:
* It is available on every platform
* It is highly configurable
* It is 100% keyboard-driven
* It is extendable with plugins
* It allows for a high degree of precision in text editing
* It provides powerful editing capabilities
* It has great documentation
* It allows editing of files both locally and remotely

Some drawbacks of vim include:
* Many defaults are undesirable
* It has a clunky scripting language
  * Places an upper bound on functionalities that can be scripted
* Destructive tasks are too easy to execute
  * Such as overwriting the paste buffer
* It default regular expression syntax is inconsistent

Vim was created in 1991 by [Bram Moolenaar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bram_Moolenaar) as an improvement over [Bill Joy's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Joy) [vi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi) (created in 1976). The name vim is a contraction of **Vi IMproved**.

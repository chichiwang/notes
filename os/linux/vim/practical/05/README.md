# Command-Line Mode
Vim traces its ancestry back to vi where the modal editing paradigm was conceived. Vi traces its ancestry back to a line editor called ex, which is why ex commands exist. The DNA of early Unix text editors still exists within modern Vim. Ex commands are still the best tool for some line-oriented tasks.

Command-Line mode exposes to users the vestiges of ex.

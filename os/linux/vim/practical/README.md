### Chapters

## Notation
Special notation will be used in this book to denote key-presses in Vim. The notation used will be described below.

### Key Sequences
In `Normal Mode` commands are composed by typing one or more keystrokes in sequence. Most of these sequences involve two or three keystrokes, but some are longer. These commands appear as follows:

| Notation | Meaning                               |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `x`      | Press `x` once                        |
| `dw`     | In sequence, press `d`, then `w`      |
| `dap`    | In sequence, press `d`, `a`, then `p` |

### Key Combinations
`<C-p>` does not mean to press `<`, then `C`, then `-`, and so on. `<C-p>` represents `Ctrl+p` (while holding down the `<Ctrl>` key, press `p`). Vim's own documentation uses this notation to denote key combinations (`:h key-notation` for more). This notation is useful to represent key combinations within a sequence, such as:

| Notation     | Meaning                                                               |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<C-n>`      | While holding `<Ctrl>` press `n`                                      |
| `g<C-]>`     | Press `g`, then while holding `<Ctrl>` press `]`                      |
| `<C-r>0`     | While holding `<Ctrl>` press `r`, then release `<Ctrl>` and press `0` |
| `<C-w><C-=>` | While holding `<Ctrl>` press `w` then `=`                         |

### Placeholders
Some commands in Vim must be followed by a particular kind of keystroke, while other commands can be followed by any key on the keyboard. Curly braces are used to denote the set of valid keystrokes that can follow a command. Some examples:

| Notation          | Meaning                                                                 |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `f{char}`         | Press `f`, followed by any other character                              |
| `` `{a-z} ``      | Press `` ` ``, followed by any lowercase letter                         |
| `m{a-zA-Z}`       | Press `m`, followed by any lowercase or uppercase letter                |
| `d{motion}`       | Press `d`, followed by any motion command                               |
| `<C-r>{register}` | While holding `<Ctrl>` press `r`, followed by the address of a register |

### Special Keys
Some keys are called by name. The following table shows a selection of them:

| Notation  | Meaning                                                 |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<Esc>`   | Press the Escape key                                    |
| `<CR>`    | Press the carriage return key (also known as `<Enter>`) |
| `<Ctrl>`  | Press the Control key                                   |
| `<Tab>`   | Press the Tab key                                       |
| `<Shift>` | Press the Shift key                                     |
| `<S-Tab>` | While holding `<Shift>` press `<Tab>`                   |
| `<Up>`    | Press the up arrow key                                  |
| `<Down>`  | Press the down arrow key                                |
| `‚éµ`       | Press the space bar                                     |

### Switching Modes
It is common to switch between Normal and Insert mode while using Vim. Each keystroke could mean something different depending on which mode is active. An alternative style will be used to represent keystrokes entered in Insert mode, to differentiate them from Normal mode keystrokes.

Consider this example:
`cw`replacement&lt;Esc&gt;. The Normal mode `cw` command deletes to the end of the current word and switches to Insert mode. Then the sequence types out the word "replacement" before pressng the `<Esc>` key to switch back to Normal mode again.

The Normal mode keystroke notation is also used for Visual mode keystrokes. The Insert mode styling will be used to indicate keystrokes entered in Command-Line mode and Replace mode. Which mode is active should be clear from context.

### Command Line
Some tips will execute a command-line, either in the shell or from inside Vim. The context of the command line will be differentiated by the prompt preceeding the command.

| Prompt | Meaning                                                   |
| ------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| $      | Enter the command line in an external shell               |
| :      | Use Command-Line mode to execute an Ex command            |
| /      | Use Command-Line mode to perform a forward search         |
| ?      | Use Command-Line mode to perform a backward search        |
| =      | Use Command-Line mode to evaluate a Vim script expression |

Any time an Ex command is listed inline (such as `:write`), following it up by pressing the `<CR>` key is implicit in the tip.

However, Vim's search command allows a preview of the first match before pressing `<CR>`. When a search command is listed inline (such as /pattern`<CR>`) the `<CR>` keystroke is listed explicitly. If it is missing from a search command, the `<CR>` is meant to be excluded.

### Showing the Cursor Position
When showing the contents of a buffer it is useful to indicate where the cursor is positioned. In this example, the cursor is placed on the first letter of the word "One":

<ins>O</ins>ne two three

When a change involves several steps the contents of the buffer pass through intermediate states. To illustrate this process a table will be used to show the commands executed in the left column and the contents of the buffer in the right column:

| Keystrokes | Buffer Contents          |
| ---------- | ------------------------ |
| {start}    | <ins>O</ins>ne two three |
| `dw`       | <ins>t</ins>wo three     |

In row 2 the `dw` command will delete the word under the cursor. The contents of the buffer shown in the same row display the state of the buffer after the command has been run.

### Highlighting Search Matches
When demonstrating Vim's search command any matches in the buffer can be demonstrated by bold text. In the following example, searching for the string "the" causes the four occurrences of the pattern to be bolded:

| Keystrokes | Buffer Contents                                                                                           |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| {start}    | **<ins>t</ins>he** problem with these new recruits is that they don't keep their boots clean.             |
| /the`<CR>` | **the** problem with **<ins>t</ins>he**se new recruits is that **the**y don't keep **the**ir boots clean. |

### Selecting Text in Visual Mode
Visual mode allows for the selection of text in the buffer to operate on. In the below example the `it` text object is used to select the contents of the &lt;a&gt; tag:

| Keystrokes | Buffer Contents                                                                       |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| {start}    | &lt;a <ins>h</ins>ref="http[]()://pragprog.com/dnvim/"&gt;Practical Vim&lt;/a&gt;     |
| `vit`      | &lt;a href="http[]()://pragprog.com/dnvim/"&gt;**Practical Vi<ins>m</ins>**&lt;/a&gt; |

Note that the styling for a Visual selection is the same as for highlighted search matches. It should be clear from the context whether this style represents a search match or a Visual selection.

## Using Example Files
The examples in _Practical Vim_ may begin by showing the contents of a file _before_ modification. These code listings include a link to the code:

**[macros/incremental.text](./code/macros/incremental.txt)**
<pre lang="text">
partridge in a pear tree
turtle doves
French hens
calling birds
golden rings
</pre>

Each time the file is linked along with the text in this manner, the example file can be used to follow along with the tips. These examples and source code can be downloaded from this notes repository and were originally sourced from [https://media.pragprog.com/titles/dnvim2/code/dnvim2-code.zip](https://media.pragprog.com/titles/dnvim2/code/dnvim2-code.zip).

## Using Vim's Factory Settings
Some examples in this book may not work as expected if using a customized version of Vim (with plugins). Vim can be launched with default settings using flags:

```shell
$ vim -u NONE -N
```

The `-u NONE` flag tells Vim not to source the `vimrc` file on startup: customizations will not be applied and plugins will be disabled. For older versions of Vim not loading a `vimrc` file activates `vi` compatible mode causing many useful features to be disabled. The `-N` flag prevents this mode by setting the 'nocompatible' option. Since Vim 8.0 the 'nocompatible' option is set by default rendering the `-N` flag unnecessary.

For most examples in _Practical Vim_ this should be enough to provide the same experience described by the examples. However, with plugins disabled some of Vim's built-in features implemented with Vim script will not work. The following file contains the absolute minimum requirement to activate Vim's built-in plugins:

**[essential.vim](./code/essential.vim)**
<pre lang="text">
<b>set</b> nocompatible
<b>filetype</b> plugin <b>on</b>
</pre>

When launching Vim, this configuration can be specified instead:
```shell
$ vim -u code/essentials.vim
```

With Vim's built-in plugins enabled, features such as `netrw` and omni-completion will be available.

## The Role of Vim Script
Vim script enables the addition of new functionality to Vim, or the ability to change existing functionality. _Practical Vim_ will not dive too deeply into Vim script, although there will be a few examples of how it can be used to aid common tasks.

_Practical Vim_ shows how to get by with Vim's core functionality with no third-party plugins assumed. There are a handful of small exceptions that will show the power of Vim script.

## Vim Versions
All examples in _Practical Vim_ were tested on version 8.0 of Vim. That said, version 7.3 is modern enough to include most of the functionality covered in this book.

### What's New in Vim 8
Version 8.0 of Vim was released in September 2016. In earlier versions Vim would run in vi-compatible mode by default. In version 8 vi-compatible mode must be explicitly opted into.

The most significant new features in Vim 8 are enhancements to Vim script. Vim now supports job control and asynchronous I/O: the ability to start and stop external processes and communicate with them by exchanging messages in the background. This is useful for tasks such as syntax checking and generating auto-completion suggestions. Previously such processes had to run synchronously causing Vim to be non-responsive until the process completed.

## Optional Features
Some of Vim's functionality can be disabled during compilation. When configuring the build, the flag `--with-features=tiny` can be provided to disable all but the most fundamental features (features are also labeled `small`, `normal`, `big`, and `huge`). The complete feature list can be viewed using `:h +feature-list`.

To check what features are available in any given Vim compilation, use the `:version` command.

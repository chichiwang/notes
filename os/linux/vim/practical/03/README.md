# Insert Mode
Although many operations are triggered from [Normal mode](../02/README.md) (delete, yank, put) some functionality is within easy reach from Insert mode. There is a convenient shortcut for pasting text from a register without leaving Insert mode, there are two easy ways for inserting unusual characters that are not represented on the keyboard.

Replace mode is a special case for Insert mode which overwrites existing characters in the document. There is also Insert Normal mode, a submode that allows the firing of a single Normal mode command before returning to Insert mode.

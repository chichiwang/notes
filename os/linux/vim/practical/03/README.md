# Insert Mode
Although many operations are triggered from [Normal mode](../02/README.md) (delete, yank, put) some functionality is within easy reach from Insert mode. There is a convenient shortcut for pasting text from a register without leaving Insert mode, there are two easy ways for inserting unusual characters that are not represented on the keyboard.

Replace mode is a special case for Insert mode which overwrites existing characters in the document. There is also Insert Normal mode, a submode that allows the firing of a single Normal mode command before returning to Insert mode.

## Make Corrections Instantly from Normal Mode
_Besides using the backspace key there are a couple of Insert mode commands to make corrections immediately without exiting Insert mode._

When making a typing error, a common method of correction is to use the backspace key to correct the error. As long as the error is at the end of the word just typed this is the quickest strategy for correction. When a mistake is made at the beginning of a word deleting the entire words and typing it out again can be quick as long as the typist is fast.

Another option in Vim is to switch to Normal mode, navigate to the start of the word, fix the error, then hit `A` to continue typing on the same line. This context switching can be cognatively awkward. In Insert mode the following chords are also available for corrections:

| Keystrokes | Effect                                |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `<C-h>`    | Delete back one character (backspace) |
| `<C-w>`    | Delete back one word                  |
| `<C-u>`    | Delete back to the start of the line  |

These commands are not unique to Insert mode, nor to Vim itself. They can be used in Vim's command line as wel as in the bash shell.

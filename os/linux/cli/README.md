## Overview
The past and future of system administration are heavily skewed towards the command line, over graphical interfaces. The reasons for this are: efficiency and infrastructure automation.

Efficiency: the speed at which you can accomplish rote, repetitive tasks favor the command line.

Infrastructure Automation: managing infrastructure is best done through automation and that is best executed through scripting, often through terminal sessions. Remote scripting loves command lines

### Using Linux Help Resources
Most programs in Linux come with their own manual files. These can be accessed via the command `man`.

Running `info` will give you a navigatable menu of programs installed and their manuals. You can navigate this program using the arrow keys and pressing enter.

## Python 2 vs Python 3
**TLDR**: Just use Python 3.

Python 3 adoption did not go smoothly. Today (May 2019) you will still see Python 2 being used, mostly 2.7 versions.

| Python 2                                         | Python 3                        |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| Last version 2.7.13 released in Dec. 2016        | Released Dec. 2008              |
| Maintained, but no new features                  | New features being added        |
| End of Life (EOL) in 2020                        | Unicode supported by default    |
| Still default on many systems (ie: Ubuntu 18.04) | Cleared some Python 2 confusion |
| Syntax: `print "Hello World"`                    | Syntax: `print("Hello World")`  |
|                                                  | Minor differences from Python 2 |

Not a lot of differences in terms of syntax.

# Chi-chi Wang Presents: Big Ol' Repo Of Notes
This repository stores, in `README.md` files and [Markdown format](https://www.markdownguide.org/), notes from courses, research, and investigations conducted in the discipline of software development.

The topics can range from general computing concepts, information technology, computer science, programming, language patterns, language paradigms, to specific language syntax and learning courses.

The goal is to have a store of knowledge collected in one location and shared. Best efforts will be made to attribute links back to sources of information, and to track the dates when these notes were made.

## Disclaimer
As this repository is built out directories may get moved and renamed. `README.md` files may be created and removed.

Over time the structure of this repository will evolve to accommodate attempts to structure and categorize the knowledge contained. Some directories may be empty save a Table of Contents linking to deeper-nested directories. This is to leave a place to expand on a broader topic while providing links to notes on a more specific topic under that broader umbrella.

For example: The [README.md](./paradigms/declarative/README.md) for [Declarative Programming](./paradigms/declarative) may remain sparse, only providing a link to [Functional Programming](./paradigms/declarative/functional) which contains [course notes for a functional programming book](./paradigms/declarative/functional/composing-software). This is because `functional programming` is recognized to be one approach to programming under the `declarative` style of programming, which notes may expand on later.

## Overview
Python is a programming language developed by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980's in the Netherlands. It is open-source with a very active community. Today it is maintained by the Python Software Foundation.

Attributes of the language:
* Strongly typed
  * Types are fixed for variables
* Dynamically typed
  * Type-checking is done at runtime
  * Duck-typed
* General purpose programming language
* Interpreted language
  * Actually compiled down to byte-code before execution
  * Does not have a compilation phase, so the exerperience is that of an interpreted language
* Syntax is designed to be: clear, readable, expressive
  * White-space aware
* Python implementations
  * CPython
    * Written in C
    * Most common distribution
    * Runs on the native machine
  * Jython
    * Written in JAVA
    * Runs on the JVM
  * Iron Python
    * Written in C#
    * Runs on .NET Runtime
  * Pypy
    * Written in RPython
    * Runs on the native machine and others

Python comes with a broad standard library. An aspect of the Python philosophy is that `Batteries Come Included`. The [Standard Library documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/) is available at [python.org/](https://www.python.org/).

For many people Python represents a philosophy of writing code. Principles of clarity and readability are part of what it means to write correct or "pythonic" code.

The [Zen of Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/) are a set of principles and guidelines to keep in mind when coding.
